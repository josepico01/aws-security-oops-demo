# 📂 Default VPC with Unrestricted Security Groups

## 🧨 The "Oops!"
Resources are deployed in the default VPC with open security group rules.

## 🔍 Why It’s a Problem
- Broad access by default
- Increases attack surface

## ✅ Secure It
- Create custom VPCs with limited access
- Always audit security group settings
